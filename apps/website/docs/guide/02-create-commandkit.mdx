# create-commandkit

Besides installing CommandKit to your existing project, you can also start a new one with `create-commandkit` — a command-line utility used for creating new discord.js bots with CommandKit.

## Usage

If you want to create a new CommandKit application, simply run the following command:

```
npm create commandkit@latest
```

This will start the CLI in the current directory.

### Development version

Similar to the main package, you could try the `dev` version of create-commandkit:

:::warning
The development version is likely to have bugs.
:::

```
npm create commandkit@dev
```

## Prompts

When running create-commandkit, you should be asked the following questions:

- **Directory:** Defines where your project will be located. It defaults to the current working directory.
- **Package Manager:** Lets you choose which package manager to use — npm, pnpm, or Yarn.
- **Language ([Development version](#development-version) only):** The language to use for your project — JavaScript or TypeScript.
- **Module Type:** Allows you to pick between CommonJS (using require and module.exports), and ESM (using import and export).
- **Bot Token:** Asks you for your bot token, and writes it into the `.env` file where it will be stored.

After these questions are answered, your project solution should appear in the selected folder.
